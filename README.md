## Tracker for Calories - .NET Application with Code-First Database

- Cool little Application with wich you can describe your meals as their different Ingredients with their respective nutritional values. You can then track your "nutritional score" for each day.
- Uses the materialSkin Theme from Google

## Note: This was my very first real project for private use. It features horrible naming, structure and code in general. I didn't actually knew how to manufacture projects the right way.

- made in 2023 and got not updated since
